# Real-Time-Audio-Equalizer-using-Parametric-Filters
This MATLAB project realises a parametric audio equalizer which enhances specific frequency bands (Bass, Midrange, Treble, Presence, and Brilliance) of an audio signal It uses FIR bandpass filters designed with the Hamming window technique and allows customizable gain control for each band.

ðŸ”§ Key Features

Five-band equalization: Boost or cut gain for Bass, Midrange, Treble, Presence and Brilliance.

FIR filter design: Implements clean and efficient filters using fir1() with Hamming window.

Visualization: Frequency response plots for each band enable the user to better visualize the filter characteristics.

Real time processing simulation: Filters are applied to the audio signal one after the other and the enhanced output is played back.

Audio export: Export the equalized audio output to a new .wav file.
